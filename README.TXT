Universe Explorer is an endless runner and the first game that I’ve ever created.
The player traverses through the cosmos in a spaceship when they accidentally
stumble across the asteroid belt and become showered with lighting fast asteroids.
The player must survive as long as possible by destroying the asteroids with lasers
or by dodging them. The asteroids become increasingly hard to avoid as more of them
spawn and they move faster as time goes on. However, not all hope is lost as the 
player can pick up temporary upgrades to their spaceship, allowing them to shoot faster
or with multiple lasers. These upgrades can also be combined to create an even 
stronger spaceship. The player’s final score is based off of how many asteroids they
destroy and how long they survive for.
